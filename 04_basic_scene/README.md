This is part of the "Imperfect VR" workshop [https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr](https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr).

This a basic scene with some sound, text, animation and a little interaction. There is a detailed tutorial on how to build a scene like this at [Build with Basic HTML](https://aframe.io/docs/0.9.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html).

			<h2>End User And Seller Agreement</h2>
<p> The terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Terms") constitute a
 legally binding agreement between NETRINOMEDIA and you ("You" or 
"Your") regarding the terms on which NETRINOMEDIA offers You access to 
its Website and Service. Your use of the Website or Service constitutes 
acceptance of these Terms. </p>
<h2>I. Definitions</h2>
<p>1. <strong>"Content"</strong> refers to any material published at 
NETRINOMEDIA including but not limited to wire files, models, textures, 
plug-ins, video games, video game modifications, motion files, 
collections, packages, materials, scripts, shapes, custom UI skins, 
tutorials, frequently asked questions, words, music, films, images, and 
software. </p>
<p>2. <strong>"For Sale"</strong> includes all Content that requires a purchase of license rights, as distinguished from Content available for free download. </p>
<p>3. <strong>"Incorporated Content"</strong> refers to Content that 
cannot be extracted from an application or product and used as 
stand-alone Content without the use of reverse engineering tools or 
techniques. For avoidance of doubt, Incorporated Content is the use of 
Content that is not intended to allow further distribution of the 
Content outside of the application or product containing the 
Incorporated Content and shall not include any Content embodied in or by
 printable 3D models offered for sale. </p>
<p>4. <strong>"Member"</strong> refers to any person who creates a user account at NETRINOMEDIA. </p>
<p>5. <strong>"Service"</strong> refers to transmission, license, or 
purchase of Content to and from NETRINOMEDIA via the NETRINOMEDIA 
Website or any approved web portal either currently in existence or in 
the future. </p>
<p>6. <strong>"Valid Sale"</strong> refers to a sale of license rights 
in Content or other property via NETRINOMEDIA, where the appropriate 
share of proceeds is received by a Seller who published the Content. 
Content For Sale via NETRINOMEDIA which is returned is not an example of
 a Valid Sale. </p>
<p>7. <strong>"Seller"</strong> refers to the submitting individual or business who publishes Content at NETRINOMEDIA. </p>
<h2>II. License Agreement Between Seller and Member</h2>
<p> <strong>A. License Grant for transmission of Content from Seller to Member</strong></p>
<p>For any transmission of Content from a Seller to another Member, 
whether the transmission was the result of a license or free download, 
the following terms apply unless more restrictive terms are specified in
 the area provided by NETRINOMEDIA for custom license terms: </p>
<p><strong>1. Ownership. </strong><br>
  Unless explicitly provided for in custom license terms set forth in 
the area provided by NETRINOMEDIA and which must be subject to 
acceptance by Member before or at the point of sale, the Seller retains,
 subject to any license agreement between the Seller and NETRINOMEDIA, 
copyright in Content purchased or downloaded by any Member via 
NETRINOMEDIA. In using the NETRINOMEDIA systems and Website, you agree 
that any additional EULA, license, custom license, or Seller 
requirements inserted into Seller products in any area outside that 
explicitly provided by NETRINOMEDIA are invalid, void ab initio, and 
without effect as they relate to those purchases effective April 22, 
2010. </p>
<p><strong>2. Valid License. </strong><br>
  Any license rights relating to Content For Sale via NETRINOMEDIA are 
contingent upon the transfer of money from the Member to the Seller. All
 license rights terminate immediately and without notice if a sale is 
reversed for any reason. </p>
<p><strong>3. Rights Granted. </strong><br>
  For any Sellers who provide NETRINOMEDIA with any type of Content for free distribution or sale, the following terms apply: </p>
<p>Seller hereby grants to NETRINOMEDIA, and by the act of delivering 
Content to us, grant a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license in 
any medium now known or hereinafter invented to: (a) reproduce, set 
prices for, sell, and distribute net proceeds from any sale, in whole or
 in part on Seller’s behalf; and to publicly perform, publicly display, 
digitally perform, or transmit for promotional and commercial purposes; 
(b) create and use samples of the Content for the purpose of 
demonstrating or promoting Seller products or services or those of 
NETRINOMEDIA; (c) use any trademarks, service marks or trade names 
incorporated in the Content in connection with Seller material; and (d) 
use the name and likeness of any individuals represented in the Content 
only in connection with Your material. </p>
<p>The Seller grants to the Member who either purchases license rights 
to Content via a Valid Sale, or downloads freely available Content 
submitted by the Seller, a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual license 
in any medium now known or hereinafter invented to: (a) reproduce, post,
 promote, license, sell, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally 
perform, or transmit for promotional and commercial purposes; (b) use 
any trademarks, service marks or trade names incorporated in the Content
 in connection with Seller material; and (c) use the name and likeness 
of any individuals represented in the Content only in connection with 
Your material. The Member license to Content in this paragraph is 
limited to Incorporated Content. Such use or republication, including 
sale or distribution of Content that is not Incorporated Content is 
prohibited. Use or republication of Content in any software or other 
application, such as a software library, that allows users to generate, 
by using included content, imagery or renderings that can be sold, is 
prohibited.  For illustration, approved distribution or use of Content 
as Incorporated Content includes, but is not limited to: </p>
<p>(i) As rendered still images or moving images; resold as part of a feature film, broadcast, or stock photography. </p>
<p>(ii) As purchased by a game’s creators as part of a game if the 
Content is contained inside a proprietary format and displays inside the
 game during play, but not for users to re-package as goods distributed 
or sold inside a virtual world. </p>
<p>(iii) As Content published within a book, poster, t-shirt or other item. </p>
<p>(iv) As a printable 3D model as part of a manufactured product, 
including as a physical object such as a toy, doll, or model, so long as
 such printable 3D model or object is only sold as part of the 
manufactured product (but not as a 3D model sold alone). </p>
<p>Special Restrictions for editorial Content.  In addition to the 
restrictions above, certain Content is marked “editorial” and has 
additional license restrictions.  Members may only use Content marked 
“editorial” for legitimate, editorial purposes on some issue of 
journalistic, editorial, cultural or otherwise newsworthy value.  
Editorial uses include use of the Content in a news program, 
news-related website, or news-related video media.  Member understands 
and agrees that this Content may contain material that is not released 
from its rights holders.  These restrictions do not apply if you 
otherwise have all the intellectual property rights necessary for your 
intended use (such as a company purchasing its own products, authorized 
advertising agencies, or licensees).  The burden is on each user to 
confirm it has any rights outside of the editorial restrictions. </p>
<p><strong>4. Rights Not Granted. </strong><br>
  Absent a written grant of rights greater than that contained in 
paragraph 3 above, all other rights or sub-divisions of rights generally
 included in copyright are excluded from this license and remain the 
property of Seller. </p>
<p><strong>5. Resale. </strong><br>
  The resale or redistribution by the Member of any Content obtained 
from NETRINOMEDIA, whether For Sale or freely available for download, 
whether part of a Valid Sale or not, is expressly prohibited unless it 
is Incorporated Content as licensed above. </p>
<p><strong>6. Returned Content. </strong><br>
  In the event a Member returns any Content, whether acquired by Valid 
Sale or freely available for download, all license rights granted herein
 terminate and the Member must immediately destroy any and all copies 
contained on any type of media under the control or possession of the 
Member. </p>
<h2>B. General Terms </h2>
<p>In addition to the above terms that apply to certain contexts, the following terms apply to all types of Content. </p>
<p><strong>1. Ownership. </strong><br>
  Seller retains ownership of the copyrights and all other rights in 
Seller Content, subject to the non-exclusive rights granted to us under 
this agreement. Seller is free to grant similar rights to others during 
and after the term of this agreement. </p>
<p><strong>2. Termination. </strong><br>
  The license grant contained in this agreement can be terminated using 
the guidelines below. NETRINOMEDIA reserves the right, notwithstanding 
the guidelines below, to terminate this agreement at any time and 
without notice if any Content submitted violates the representations and
 warranties of paragraph three (3) below. This agreement may be 
terminated at any time by either party upon written notice via email or 
regular mail. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to mean that a
 Seller may not submit or delete Content from the material submitted by 
such Seller as part of general maintenance of such Seller’s account. </p>
<p><strong>3. Representations and Warranties. </strong><br>
  Seller represents and warrants that: (a) the Content is Your original 
work, and contains no copyrighted material of any kind that Seller is 
not the exclusive owner of, including but not limited to: music and/or 
synchronization rights, images (moving or still) of any kind, writings 
of any kind, and model clearances/releases; (b) Seller has full right 
and power to enter into and perform this agreement, and have secured all
 third party consents necessary to enter into this agreement; (c) the 
Content does not and will not infringe on any third party’s copyright, 
patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, rights of 
publicity or privacy, or moral rights; (d) the Content does not and will
 not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation; (e) the Content 
is not and will not be defamatory, libelous, pornographic, obscene or 
evocative of racial hatred of any kind; (f) the Content does not and 
will not contain any viruses or other programming routines that 
detrimentally interfere with computer systems or data; (g) the Content 
does not contain any material that, as a condition of use, requires 
additional license restrictions such as requiring the publication of 
source code or Content that limits commercial exploitation of 
Incorporated Content; and (h) all factual assertions that Seller has 
made and will make to us are true and complete. Seller agrees to execute
 and deliver documents to us, upon our reasonable request, that evidence
 or effectuate our rights under this agreement. </p>
<p><strong>4. Determining Type of Content. </strong><br>
  NETRINOMEDIA implements and maintains business practices which enable 
us to accurately categorize Content that Sellers deliver to us. If 
NETRINOMEDIA makes an error in good faith, however and consequently 
exceed our license rights, Seller’s sole and exclusive remedy will be 
for us to take all reasonable steps to promptly correct the error as 
soon as NETRINOMEDIA becomes aware of the error. </p>
<p><strong>5. Royalty Payments &amp; Commission. </strong><br>
  Seller will be entitled to a royalty of 60% (unless otherwise 
specified) of all proceeds from the Valid Sale of Seller’s Content paid 
by check monthly. The remaining 40% of all proceeds from Valid Sales is 
deducted by NETRINOMEDIA as a commission. Seller hereby authorizes 
NETRINOMEDIA to collect and distribute such royalties and commissions.  
Seller may be eligible to commissions as high as 70% for participation 
in an exclusivity program with NETRINOMEDIA 
(http://www.NETRINOMEDIA.com/sell-3d-models.php). </p>
<p><strong>6. Confidential Marketplace Information. </strong><br>
  As part of Seller’s participation in NETRINOMEDIA, Seller may have 
access to certain reports, records, and other business information 
available only to Sellers. Such information is the confidential 
information of NETRINOMEDIA and should be treated as confidential. 
Seller should not disclose such confidential information and should use 
reasonable physical and electronic security measures to safeguard such 
confidential information. </p>

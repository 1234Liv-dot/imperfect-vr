# The Rabbit, the Chicken, the AK-47.

This is part of the "Imperfect VR" workshop [https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr](https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr).

**This scene is currently work in progress and may be broken.**

This scene gets a bit more complex than the others. You can move around and interact with some of the inhabitants. A little story unfolds.

## For the technically interested:

In this scene we have more elements and also more logic written in JavaScript. In "04 Imperfect Treasures" we have already seen some code inside `<script>` tags. The recommended way for coding with A-Frame however is to pack our code into components, which can be shared and later be reused.

We have used components written by other people in our scenes before, especially in "05 Reality of the Virtual". For this scene we start coding components ourselves, sometimes adapting code written by others.

# The Rabbit, the Chicken, the AK-47.

This is part of the "Imperfect VR" workshop [https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr](https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr).

**This scene is currently work in progress and may be broken.**

This scene gets a bit more complex than the others. You can move around and interact with some of the inhabitants. A little story unfolds.

In this scene there are more elements and there is also more logic written in JavaScript. In "[04 Imperfect Treasures](https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr/tree/master/04_imperfect_treasures)" we already have seen some code inside `<script>` tags. The recommended way in A-Frame however is to write our code as [components](https://aframe.io/docs/master/introduction/writing-a-component.html), which can be shared and reused.

This scene also uses many components written by other people.

# Imperfect VR workshop

This is a collection of examples for my "Imperfect VR" workshop, built with A-Frame [https://aframe.io/](https://aframe.io/).

Imperfect VR: We are not aiming for a perfect reality but will have fun in the virtual. Cheap 3D assets. Blocky textures. Weird sounds. We want to stumble around with smartphones strapped to our faces. Forget VR mainstream. Motion sickness will not be avoided but guaranteed.

Imperfect VR is inspired by "Imperfect Cinema" by Allister Gall / Dan Paolantonio [http://www.imperfectcinema.com/](http://www.imperfectcinema.com/) which in turn is inspired by "For an imperfect cinema" by Julio Garc√≠a Espinosa [http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC20folder/ImperfectCinema.html](http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC20folder/ImperfectCinema.html).

A-Frame is a beginner-friendly but capable framework by the Mozilla people to create VR experiences from markup and code. Everyone who can slide a smartphone into a Google Cardboard [https://vr.google.com/cardboard/](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) can make VR experiences with A-Frame.

Each example is self-contained and has all the files (including movies) it needs in its directory structure. This is intended for workshops, where there might be no internet available. Therefore the repo is quite large.

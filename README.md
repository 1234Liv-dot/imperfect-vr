# Imperfect VR workshop

This is a collection of examples for my "Imperfect VR" workshop, built with A-Frame.

[The Imperfect VR Manifesto](https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr/blob/master/Imperfect%20VR%20Manifesto.pdf) - [Github Repository](https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr) - [See it online](https://i3games.github.io/imperfect-vr/)

Imperfect VR means we are not aiming for a perfect reality but will have fun in the virtual. Cheap 3D assets. Blocky textures. Weird sounds. Stumble around with a smartphone strapped to your face. Forget VR mainstream. Motion sickness will not be avoided but guaranteed. This workshop is based on the premise that everyone who can slide a smartphone into a [Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) can make VR experiences, even if you haven't written a single line of code before.

Imperfect VR is inspired by ["Imperfect Cinema"](http://www.imperfectcinema.com/) by Allister Gall which in turn is inspired by the essay ["For an imperfect cinema"](http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC20folder/ImperfectCinema.html) by Julio García Espinosa.

## Context and Plans

What I am aiming at are different formats - Imperfect VR jams and Imperfect VR workshops. The workshops are geared towards beginners - starting without any assumption about your background or coding experience. We go through the absolute basics, while advanced participants can get support to realize their ideas. We also discuss current politics of VR, perception, imperfection and a bit of Nietzsche.

A full day or two day workshop would be an option for teaching JavaScript, components etc.

The jams will be like game jams, people coming together for a day or a weekend and creating stuff together. The spirit of all this is captured in the [The Imperfect VR Manifesto](https://github.com/i3games/imperfect-vr/blob/master/Imperfect%20VR%20Manifesto.pdf).  

Now make a VR!

## Technical remarks

[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a beginner-friendly, but capable open source framework made by people from Mozilla. It allows creating Virtual Reality experiences from HTML markup and JavaScript code.

Each example is self-contained and has all the files it needs in its directory structure (including fonts, images, movies).

The main scene used to navigate to the individual scenes currently only makes sense for viewing the scenes on a desktop browser where you can go back and forth without interruption. The fullscreen VR mode on your mobile device must be triggered by an user action. This means you have to take the phone out of the cardboard and tap on the VR symbol each time a new scene is loaded.
